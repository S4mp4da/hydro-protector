            <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rainy days are hard enough. But what makes rainy days harder is having to hold your umbrella, belongings, and trying to open your car door all at the same time. This could damage the electronic interior of the car and your belongings get wet.  </p>

            <h2 style="font-style:oblique;font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Reason</h2>
            <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When rain gets into your car when it rains it can cause mold and mildew to grow because of the moisture causing a not to pleasant smell that is hard to get rid of. The moisture can also damage the leather and carpet causing it to become stained, stiff or fall apart. You wouldnâ€™t want to go into your car and drive and it would be really frustrating to have all these problems. That is why we created the Hydro-Protector.
